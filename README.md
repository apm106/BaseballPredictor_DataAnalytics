# BaseballPredictor_DataAnalytics
A Jupyter notebook analysis with an ML Model for predicting a baseball player's WAR. 

This project focuses on predicting baseball player performance using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can forecast a player's future performance in terms of Wins Above Replacement (WAR), based on their historical statistics. The project was inspired by a passion for baseball and a desire to explore data science, machine learning, and statistical models.

Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebook or HTML/PDF versions of the final analysis report.
